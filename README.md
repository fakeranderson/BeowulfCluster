# README

Our goal in this project was to network together four raspberry pi's into a Beowulf Cluster, grab code written in MPI from the net, then test and analyze our results. I'm providing all of my source code, my report, and two tutorials I wrote because the one I used for the installing and networking the OS's wasn't great, and there was no tutorial for the DHCP server bit.
